## Advanced Node.js Concepts

#### Implement an event-driven architecture using Node.js's EventEmitter to handle asynchronous operations

- Used in node server staring that server is started sucessfully or getting any error.

#### Use streams to efficiently process and manipulate large amounts of data in Node.js

- Create route readfile-stream to read and write a bulk amount of data

#### Implement worker threads to perform parallel processing tasks in a Node.js application

- Create multiple worker threads to perform the task synchronously and return the output as array (parellel-task)

#### Design and develop a microservice architecture with Node.js services communicating through message queues

-

#### Optimize the performance of a Node.js application by identifying and resolving bottlenecks

-

#### Implement advanced security mechanisms such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication in a Node.js application

- Created login api to generate JWT token which is required for private routes which required the role based authorization

#### Build a distributed system using Node.js that communicates through message queues

-

#### Containerize a Node.js application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform

- Created a dockerize node app with container based service like(postgres for database, redis for caching)

#### Able to write unit test cases

-

#### Able to write the integration test cases

-

## Advanced Database Integration

#### Advanced querying techniques

-

#### Database transactions for maintaining data integrity

-

#### Database indexing rules (ESR Rules)

-

#### Database indexing and query optimization

-

#### Database migration and schema management tools (e.g., Knex, Sequelize, TypeORM)

-

#### Using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations

-
